# ENG-1P13-Project2
The use of remote surgery or remote mentoring of physicians could be a potential solution to the
problem that, people living in rural and remote areas of Canada have few accesse to basic healthcare. 

An important task in surgery is sterilization of equipment which is used in order to remove microbes, spores and viruses.
Sterilization is commonly performed by autoclaves; a process where instruments are placed in a container that
allows exposure to pressurized steam. 

In this projecet, the group was divided into two sub-teams to design a
system for securely transfering a surgical instruments to an autoclave for sterilization.

As apart of the computation team we were instructed to produce a computer program that interacted with an EMG
emulator. The overall goal of the program was to generate 6 different containers, all randomly spawned in.

Using the EMG emulator, the movement of the q-arm to pick up, grip and transfer the containers to their
appropriate drop off locations was possible. Multiple functions were created to complete this objective. For
example, control gripper, and move_end_effector. When creating each function certain rules and principles
needed to be followed and implemented. All the created functions were then called within a main function so
that they may work together. In summary the program executed effectively and efficiently, allowing for a
smooth run through.

This code is run through McMaster University's Quanser Interactive Labs.
